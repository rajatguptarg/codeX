# CodeX (Beta 1)
Text Editor written in Python using Qt framework

Can clone github repo and upload file to repo directly from the text editor

It can only support python for syntax highlighting for now.

If you would like to contribute please note that

when you create new syntax highlighting, make filename, sytanx<language> (such as Ruby, C) under syntax folder then add language name to the list in syntaxPack.py under syntax folder.

import the new syntax file to main.py at line no.7

add the syntax activation function at def syntaxActivated (Line no.241) [in main.py]
